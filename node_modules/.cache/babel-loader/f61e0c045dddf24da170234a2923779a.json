since July 2016 and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.<br/>\n\n          Our vision is to give everyone in the world the opportunity to enjoy a healthy financial life.<br/><br/>\n\n          What products do you offer?<br/><br/>\n          At the moment, we offer three types of mobile-only bank account: a personal account, a business<br/>\n          account and a joint account.<br/>\n\n          We built our mobile-only personal current account first and recently added joint and business, <br/>\n          which feature all the benefits of the original account with some great additional features. <br/>\n          You don’t need a personal account to apply for a Starling business account, but you will <br/>\n          need one to get a joint account. You can apply for either of the other accounts in the <br/>\n          main menu of your app on iOS, or in ‘Account Management’ on Android.<br/><br/>\n\n          Can I download on iOS or Android?<br/><br/>\n          The app is available on both iOS and Android!<br/>\n\n          What are the minimum OS requirements to download the app?<br/>\n          If you have an iOS device, the requirement to download the app is iOS 9.0 or later. It is <br/>\n          compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. If you have an Android device, the requirement is<br/>\n          5.0 or later.<br/><br/>\n\n          Where’s the technology from?<br/><br/>\n          We’ve built a full-stack bank which means that we’ve created as much of our own systems as we <br/>\n          physically can, from scratch. Essentially, this means designing software that’s resilient, fast and <br/>\n          secure making our banking technology completely unique.<br/><br/>\n\n          What about your security?<br/><br/>\n          When I open an account with Starling, will my money be safe?<br/>\n\n          Yes, your money is secure within your Starling account.

In the unlikely event that the bank were to become insolvent, your eligible deposits <br/>\n          are protected up to £85,000. To find out more, go to fscs.org.uk.<br/><br/>\n\n          What about my information?
