Prudential Regulation Authority<br/>\n          since July 2016 and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.<br/>\n\n          Our vision is to give everyone in the world the opportunity to enjoy a healthy financial life.<br/><br/>\n\n          What products do you offer?<br/><br/>\n          At the moment, we offer three types of mobile-only bank account: a personal account, a business<br/>\n          account and a joint account.<br/>\n\n          We built our mobile-only personal current account first and recently added joint and business, <br/>\n          which feature all the benefits of the original account with some great additional features. <br/>\n          You don’t need a personal account to apply for a Starling business account, but you will <br/>\n          need one to get a joint account. You can apply for either of the other accounts in the <br/>\n          main menu of your app on iOS, or in ‘Account Management’ on Android.<br/><br/>\n\n          Can I download on iOS or Android?<br/><br/>\n          The app is available on both iOS and Android!<br/>\n\n          What are the minimum OS requirements to download the app?<br/>\n          If you have an iOS device, the requirement to download the app is iOS 9.0 or later. It is <br/>\n          compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. If you have an Android device, the requirement is<br/>\n          5.0 or later.<br/><br/>\n\n          Where’s the technology from?<br/><br/>\n          We’ve built a full-stack bank which means that we’ve created as much of our own systems as we <br/>\n          physically can, from scratch. Essentially, this means designing software that’s resilient, fast and <br/>\n          secure making our banking technology completely unique.<br/><br/>\n\n          What about your security?<br/><br/>\n          When I open an account with Starling, will my money be safe?<br/>\n\n          Yes, your money is secure within your Starling account. Starling Bank is authorised by the Prudential<br/>\n          Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct<br/>\n          Authority (FCA). Your Starling Bank account is also protected by the Financial Services Compensation<br/>\n          Scheme (FSCS). In the unlikely event that the bank were to become insolvent, your eligible deposits <br/>\n          are protected up to £85,000. To find out more, go to fscs.org.uk.<br/><br/>\n\n          What about my information? Is that safe?<br/><br/>\n\n          The protection and security of your personal data is of paramount importance to us. We use advanced data<br/>\n          encryption and storing technologies that ensure your personal information and transactions are sent and <br/>\n          stored securely. Our privacy notice provides more information on what data we collect and how it gets used.<br/>\n\n          You can also read more about how we keep your account secure here.<br/><br/>\n\n          Do you offer online banking via a web portal?<br/><br/>\n          Starling began with the belief that we would do one thing well — that’s why we created a fully functioning current<br/>\n          account that can be managed from one place: your mobile phone.<br/>\n\n          Do all the things you normally expect from online banking such as standing orders, direct debits and Faster Payments,<br/>\n          plus experience high-tech security features and smart money management tools. It’s banking that keeps up with your <br/>\n          lifestyle.<br/><br/>\n\n          Can I use my card overseas and will I be charged?<br/><br/>\n          The Starling card is the ultimate travel buddy — welcome anywhere you see the Mastercard acceptance logo.<br/>\n\n          Starling will not add any fees or charges when using your card abroad. Mastercard foreign exchange rates will apply for <br/>\n          transactions outside the UK or online in foreign currency. It’s also free to withdraw domestic and foreign cash from an <br/>\n          ATM outside the UK (remember you may be charged by the ATM provider, the same as in the UK).<br/>\n\n          Take a look at our pricing policy for more info: www.starlingbank.com/legal/<br/><br/>\n\n\n          weekday, the funds will become available in your Starling account the next business day.\n        </div>\n      </div><br/>\n\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Faq\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
